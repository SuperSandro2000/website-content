On 12 August, we published our first article on RIPE Labs for the series 
[‘IXP from Scratch’](https://labs.ripe.net/author/liske/ixp-from-scratch-building-a-new-ix/). In the series
we describe the essential points for building an IXP and what problems and requirements we have overcome so far. 

Shortly thereafter, the RIPE Labs article contest was launched, where we submitted our first article. The winners 
will receive a ticket to RIPE89 in Prague. Thanks to the excellent work of the authors and reviewers our article
won and we are very pleased that it was so well received by the community.

Thank you to all the hard-working contributors, readers and reviewers, we look forward to seeing you at RIPE in Prague!
