[RIPE Labs](https://labs.ripe.net) is a place for network operators, developers and industry experts to share and discuss Internet-related news, ideas, analyses and tools for the benefit of the RIPE community.
On 12 August, we published our first article on RIPE Labs in the series 
[‘IXP from Scratch’](https://labs.ripe.net/author/liske/ixp-from-scratch-building-a-new-ix/). In this series,
we describe the requirements and challenges of building an IXP and how we overcome them.
Our articles have now won the RIPE Labs Article Competition.

The RIPE Labs Article Competition recognizes particularly helpful and interesting articles. The award sponsors our participation in [RIPE89](https://ripe89.ripe.net/) in Prague. We are very much looking forward to present our results on site.

Thank you all for you interest and trust! More articles will follow ;).
