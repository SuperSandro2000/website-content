On 12 August, we published our first article on RIPE Labs for the series 
[‘IXP from Scratch’](https://labs.ripe.net/author/liske/ixp-from-scratch-building-a-new-ix/). In the series
we describe the essential points for building an IXP and what problems and requirements we have overcome so far. 

Shortly thereafter, the RIPE Labs article contest was launched, where we submitted our first article. The winners 
will receive a ticket to [RIPE89](https://ripe89.ripe.net/) in Prague. Thanks to the excellent work of the authors and 
reviewers our article won and we are very pleased that it was so well received by the community.

Thank you to all the hard-working contributors, readers and reviewers. Furthermore, we are looking forward to seeing 
you at RIPE in Prague!
