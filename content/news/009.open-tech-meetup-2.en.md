The second Open Tech Meetup took place at TU Dresden at the beginning of August. The DD-IX team reported on current developments such as the PoP in City Center DC, new peers and our upcoming RIPE Labs article series.
Of particular interest to network engineers reading this should be our announcement of the [DDNOG mailing list] (https://dd-ix.net/g/ddnog).
After the half-hour presentations, the meetup was opened up for discussions on peering and network technologies.

The discussions continued at Altes-Wettb√ºro where delicious food and wine were served to end the evening in a relaxed atmosphere.

Our slides are [online](https://talks.dd-ix.net/otm2024_08/otm2024_08.pdf) available.
