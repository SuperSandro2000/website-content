A Dresden Internet Exchange enriches the use of the Internet in Dresden. This idea already reaches back on a long history. Already in 2005 there were ambitions to build up such an Internet Exchange in Dresden, because the importance and value of Dresden was recognized. The idea of a local Internet exchange point was that for security reasons the Dresden traffic should stay in Dresden and not first go halfway around the world. Even then, Dresden was characterized by a growing semiconductor industry, a strong automotive supply industry and the "Gl√§serne VW Manufaktur", but also by a strong service and tourism industry. The initiative at that time came from Prof. Dr. Thomas Horn, who as an Internet pioneer was the first Saxon Internet provider in 1994 with his company, today's IBH IT-Service GmbH.

The first employees from the university spurred on the idea of the Internet as an open medium. At that time, the Internet Exchange was to be called DDCIX (Dresden Commercial Internet Exchange).

But why have so many years gone by to see the DD-IX in operation today?

The answer, as is often the case, is simple. At the time, the major Internet providers had no interest and there was a lack of an active community dedicated to building and advancing Internet communications. As a company we can provide the financial means and the contacts to other providers, but the daily doing from the enthusiasm to win new customers to the technical support and further development cannot be done by one company alone.

Fortunately, until today nothing has changed in Dresden as a business location. On the contrary, the current developments show the strengths of Dresden. For the entire economy, Internet communication has gained enormous importance over the decades.

And now, behind the DD-IX, there is a multitude of members with passion, enthusiasm and vision for a long "overdue" project.
