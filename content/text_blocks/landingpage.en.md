# Internet Exchange

The DD-IX is an internet exchange for Dresden and whole Saxony. As a non-commercial platform
we are open to all organizations and providers for the multilateral exchange of Internet traffic.
Only 20â€‰km from the geographic center of Saxony, the DD-IX locations in Dresden offer the ideal
prerequisites to peer with participants in the region.


# Association

The IXP is operated by passionately committed people within the DD-IX e.V. The DD-IX e.V. is a registered
association under German law. Our mission is to create a basis for the direct exchange of internet traffic
within the region. The Internet is based on decentralized networking between providers which is efficiently enabled by IXPs. In addition to increasing the resilience of the Internet, they enable network traffic to take place in a economically and ecologically optimal way.
