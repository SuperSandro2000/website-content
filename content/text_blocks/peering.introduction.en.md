As an open and non-commercial IX, the DD-IX is open to all organizations with
an own AS. The peers are responsible for connecting their networks to the IXP
and the fulfillment of the technical requirements.

We offer free consulting to organisations which want to be connected
to DD-IX. We can bring you in contact to the local carriers and data center
operators at our IX sites.
