## What is peering?

Peering is a term from network technology. It provides for an association of ISPs (Internet Service Providers) or networks to enable data exchange between them.  This data transfer between peering partners is free of charge and offers numerous advantages.

# Why should I peer?

The goal of peering is to route traffic between participating networks more efficiently and avoid bottlenecks. Through direct peering connections provided by DD-IX, data packets can take shorter and faster routes. This results in improved network performance, which can lead to a reduction in latency.
This is an important aspect of building a robust and efficient Internet, as it forms the basis for exchanging traffic between different regions and countries. Peering allows access to content and services hosted by other networks or ISPs without having to route all traffic over the public Internet.

# Your benefits of peering using DD-IX as an Internet Exchange Point:

The improved performance already mentioned, as data is exchanged directly between peering partners. This reduces latency, and transmission speeds can be improved.

It also allows for better redundancy, as traffic can flow even if a connection to a particular network is down, as long as there are alternative peering partners. This guarantees a certain degree of fail-safety.

Peering through an IXP (Internet Exchange Point) such as the DD-IX reduces the need for expensive Internet transit services because traffic can be routed directly through the IXP.

In addition, peering increases network reach and allows access to content and services hosted by other networks and ISPs.
