# Our Vision

We want to promote Saxony as an attractive IT location with a focus on Dresden. Our main focus is the further expansion of the internet communication network. We committ as non-profit organisation for:

## Networking and Sharing Experiences

We are available as an objective point of contact for organizations, science, business and the public on issues relating to the internet. In addition to the exchange of experiences within the association and with external third parties, we conduct information and training events. Furthermore, we participate in community events.

## Operation of the DD-IX

In addition to supporting the community, we run the internet exchange DD-IX at locations in Dresden.
DD-IX sees itself as an open, non-profit platform for all internet participants with a AS in the
region of Saxony.

Besides the peering LAN and our route servers for the core operation of the IXP, we run most of the systems of the association ourselves.
