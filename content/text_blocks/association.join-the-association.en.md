# Association Work

The association is made up of committed members who work voluntarily  for the
achievement of the goals. Even though the association seems to be technical
through IXP operations we are also involved in non-technical areas.

The work in the association is organized in different boards and working groups:

- Customer & Sponsorship Acquisition
- Event Management
- Management Board
- Public Relations
- Technical Operation & Advisory Board

## Participation & Joining

Are you interested in working for the association? We are looking forward to you!

You do not have to be a member of the association to participate. But as a full member
you have your own voting rights in the corresponding boards of the association.
All legal documents of the association are linked at the bottom of this page.
