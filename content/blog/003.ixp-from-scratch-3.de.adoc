|===
|In the third article of our series ‚ÄúIXP from Scratch‚Äù, we discuss our
setup of the peering switches and route servers at
`DD-IX <https://dd-ix.net>`__, an Internet Exchange located in the city
of Dresden, Germany. We explain how we connect our two PoPs and which
security and safety mechanisms (L2 and L3) we configured to ensure
reliable operation.
|===

In this article, we start with explaining the configuration of our
switching infrastructure using common IETF protocols to implement
redundancy, full usage of resources, and seamless adaptivity in case of
failures or maintenance. We then continue presenting the configuration
of our route servers with a special focus on isolating different LANs
and dynamically exclude invalid routes.

== Building Bridges

Our switching infrastructure consists of two Arista DCS-7050SX switches
donated by third parties (thanks again!). Each switch serves one PoP.
Both switches are connected via two CWDM-based 10G links.

Right from the beginning, we aim for scalability that allows us to
easily expand our IX to connect additional switches and PoPs later
without sacrificing fault tolerance and resource sharing. Combining
plain Ethernet, link aggregation, and spanning tree might work for small
LANs with few switches, but would become a major challenge in larger
deployments since convergence in case of topology changes is slow and
flexibility to steer packet forwarding is limited. A key feature of this
classic approach, however, is that it is based on open standards and a
distributed control plane ‚Äì features that are also very important to us.
Consequently, any ``<Your vendor building bridges>`` *Software Defined
Lock-in* solution would not work for us either.

In the following, we describe our setup based on `MP-BGP EVPN
(Multiprotocol BGP Ethernet VPN) <https://doi.org/10.17487/RFC7432>`__
on top of `VxLAN (Virtual Extensible
LAN) <https://doi.org/10.17487/RFC7348>`__, both defined by the IETF.

=== Setup a Fabric

We need various broadcast domains which are implemented on the switching
hardware as common VLANs:

-  the peering (V)LAN in which peers get connected.
-  quarantine VLAN for the assessment of new peers.
-  management VLAN since we do not have a out-of-band management, yet.

Typically, large broadcast domains do not scale since unknown MAC
addresses lead to larger flooding, even in switched environments. Using
VXLAN and EVPN we can tunnel layer 2 traffic via an IP network, enabling
coherent L2 domains without spanning a VLAN across all switches. Using a
multiprotocol routing protocol allows us to provision MAC addresses via
unicast and to balance traffic across multiple ports in parallel.

Our EVPN setup uses an IGP in the underlay and full ‚Äúmeshed‚Äù iBGP
sessions between the loopback interfaces of our two switches. Instead of
the complex OSPF monster, we choose IS-IS as IGP.

=== Bundle Resources: To LAG or not to LAG?

We do not use any Link Aggregations (LAGs) for the underlay ports but
deploy *Equal-Cost Multi-Path* (ECMP) routing. Running a routing session
on each individual link instead of aggregating links on layer 2 brings
various advantages:

1. Links can be released from traffic by disabling the individual
   routing session. This allows link maintenances with zero packet loss
   since the routing protocol will gradually move the traffic instead of
   abruptly turn off ports.
2. Reconfigurations or even replacing the IGP of the underlay is
   possible without traffic disruption in the overlay.
3. BFD is performed independently on each link.

=== Detecting Errors: To BFD or not to BFD?

To quickly detect link errors in the underlay, we use `Bidirectional
Forwarding Detection (BFD) <https://doi.org/10.17487/RFC5880>`__ on all
underlay ports. This allows us to reduce IGP convergence times to a
minimum without tuning any routing protocol default timers.

We do not use BFD for MP-BGP EVPN, though, because a router interface
attached to a switch ports in the Peering LAN is not able to move, they
are virtually static. If one of our PoP switches fails or get isolated,
it does not make it any better to quickly remove the MAC addresses of
unreachable ports from the EVPN.

=== Protecting the Peering LAN

The most challenging part of setting up our switches is to protect the
*Peering LAN* to which the routers of our peers are connected to, see
also
`APNIC <https://blog.apnic.net/2024/07/17/revisiting-ixp-peering-lan-security-in-the-light-of-new-threats-and-technology-evolution/>`__
and
`MANRS <https://manrs.org/2020/12/ixp-peering-platform-an-environment-to-take-care-of/>`__.

image::003_pop.webp[]

That looks like a simple setup, doesn‚Äôt it? In reality, however,
different types of remote stations are connected to this VLAN with
different levels of trustworthiness:

-  our route servers (very trustworthy).
-  directly connected peer routers (trustworthy).
-  different types of L2 backhauls for remote peer routers (not
   trustworthy).

|image:003_backhaul.webp[]

What could possibly go wrong?

1. The Peering LAN is just a bridge and all peering ports with L2
   backhauls are building a large carrier-spanning (country-spanning?
   continent-spanning? ‚Ä¶) broadcast domain. ü•Ç No one has the intention
   to build a loop!

2. Every router in the Peering LAN can (unintentionally) be disruptive
   by using incorrect layer 2 or layer 3 addresses, doing `Proxy
   ARP <https://www.euro-ix.net/media/filer_public/3e/cb/3ecb9c73-a7f3-4771-bd28-d2e6e0abd97e/2021-09-proxy_arp_detection_at_an_ixp.pdf>`__  , or doing other weird things.

3. Even if you trust your peers, there is still a risk that a router
   could be exploited by an attacker - it doesn‚Äôt matter whether you
   trust your peers or not.

Several incidents in the past (e.g.,
`2014 <https://archive.franceix.net//en/events-and-news/news/franceix-outage-notification/>`__,
`2015 <https://web.archive.org/web/20160327075404/https://ams-ix.net/newsitems/195>`__,
`2023 <https://www.ams-ix.net/ams/outage-on-amsterdam-peering-platform>`__)
give good reasons for zero trust.

=== Peering Ports Basics

To mitigate risks, we harden each switch port leveraging our switching
configuration. The ports are configured depending on the `physical port
status setting in the IXP
Manager <https://docs.ixpmanager.org/latest/usage/interfaces/#physical-interface-settings>`__.

We automatically assign the following configuration to all ports
connecting peers having the status *Connected*:

.. code:: perl

   interface Ethernet11
      description PEER AS65372 peer1
      switchport access vlan 600
      ip access-group peer-eth11-ipv4 in
      ipv6 access-group peer-eth11-ipv6 in
      mac access-group peer-eth11 in
      no lldp transmit
      no lldp receive
      sflow enable
      storm-control broadcast level 0.01
      storm-control multicast level 0.01
      storm-control unknown-unicast level 0.01

This configuration limits Broadcast, unknown-unicast and multicast (BUM)
traffic to prevent packet storms from external networks into our fabric.
On each peering port, we use ingress sFlow sampling to build traffic
statistics. We also apply the following inbound ACLs at layer 2 and
layer 3:

.. code:: perl

   mac access-list peer-eth11
      10 remark AS65372 allow arp broadcast
      11 permit vlan 600 0x000 00:53:42:8b:7b:20 00:00:00:00:00:00 ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff 00:00:00:00:00:00 arp
      20 remark AS65372 allow nd multicast
      21 permit vlan 600 0x000 00:53:42:8b:7b:20 00:00:00:00:00:00 33:33:ff:00:00:00 00:00:00:ff:ff:ff ipv6
      30 remark AS65372 drop other broadcasts or multicasts
      31 deny vlan 600 0x000 any 01:00:00:00:00:00 fe:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff log
      40 remark AS65372 allow lan access
      41 permit vlan 600 0x000 00:53:42:8b:7b:20 00:00:00:00:00:00 any arp
      42 permit vlan 600 0x000 00:53:42:8b:7b:20 00:00:00:00:00:00 any ip
      43 permit vlan 600 0x000 00:53:42:8b:7b:20 00:00:00:00:00:00 any ipv6
      100 remark AS65372 drop any
      101 deny any any log
   ! ‚Ä¶
   mac address-table static 0053.428b.7b20 vlan 600 interface Ethernet11

The layer 2 ACL allows *IPv6 Neighbor Discovery* multicasts, *IPv4 ARP*
broadcasts but no other layer 2 non-unicast traffic. Furthermore, only
packets of the *EtherType* IPv6, IPv4, and ARP are allowed to enter
these ports: `sorry OSI, you shall not
pass <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Wars#Internet%E2%80%93OSI_Standards_War>`__.

We *require* that all peers use only a single static MAC address on
their peering ports, and add a corresponding static MAC address-table
entry.

.. code:: perl

   ipv6 access-list peer-eth11-ipv6
      10 remark AS15372 IPv6 multicast (RFC 5963)
      11 permit ipv6 any host ff02::1
      12 permit ipv6 any host ff02::2
      13 permit ipv6 any host ff02::16
      14 permit ipv6 any ff02::1:ff00:0/104
      15 deny ipv6 any ff00::/8 log
      20 remark AS65372 allow router IPv6
      21 permit vlan 600 0x000 ipv6 host 2001:db8:79::3c0c:1 any
      30 remark AS65372 deny IPv6 abuse
      31 deny vlan 600 0x000 ipv6 2001:db8:79::/64 2001:db8:79::/64 log
      100 remark allow any other traffic
      101 permit ipv6 any any
   ! ‚Ä¶
   ip access-list peer-eth11-ipv4
      10 remark AS65372 allow router IP
      11 permit vlan 600 0x000 ip host 198.51.100.71 any
      20 remark AS65372 deny IP abuse
      21 deny vlan 600 0x000 ip 198.51.100.64/26 198.51.100.64/26 log
      100 remark allow any other traffic
      101 permit ip any any

=== Filtering IPv6 Peering Addresses is Specifically Challenging

The layer 3 ACLs are used to block peers from using an IP address not
assigned to them. In IPv4, this is straightforward since we assign
peering LAN IP addresses to peers, supported by the IXP Manager. In IPv6,
this is less obvious because of link-local addresses. First, the IXP
Manager does not allow to manage (static) link-local addresses. Second,
autoconfigured link-local addresses require dedicated monitoring to
discover them. What we would like to see in the future are common rules
about the configuration of link-local IPv6 addresses in IXP peering
LANs, which ultimately will ease IP filtering.

We have link-local multicast filters following `RFC 5963 - IPv6
Deployment in Internet Exchange Points
(IXPs) <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5963>`__. This also
serves to suppress incorrectly configured router advertisements.

=== Configurations May Include Features that are not Available

We are aware that the hardware of our switches (Trident2 BCM56850
series) does not support the outer VLAN option in any ACL. Not every
setting visible in the active configuration is actually effective ‚Äì a
common ‚Äúfeature‚Äù of many switch vendors using generic software images.

This is dangerous because although the configuration on different switch
models is syntactically correct, it may (surprisingly) have different
semantics! And depending on how the ACL is written, it can behave fail
open or fail close. üòñ

Also be careful when replacing the switch in the event of a failure or
when upgrading to a new model - your ACLs might have a different
semantics.

=== Be Prepared for Maintenances

It is necessary to do maintenance on switches from time to time. We use
‚Äúinvoluntary BGP session teardown‚Äù according to `RFC 8327 - BGP session
culling <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8327#section-3.2>`__
to disable traffic forwarding on a single switch for maintenance. This
is implemented by inserting additional access control entries (ACE) at
the top of the peer ACLs during maintenance:

.. code:: perl

   ipv6 access-list peer-eth11-ipv6
      5 deny tcp 2001:db8:79::/64 eq bgp 2001:db8:79::/64
      6 deny tcp 2001:db8:79::/64 2001:db8:79::/64 eq bgp
      ! ‚Ä¶
   ! ‚Ä¶
   ip access-list peer-eth11-ipv4
      5 deny tcp 198.51.100.64/26 eq bgp 198.51.100.64/26
      6 deny tcp 198.51.100.64/26 198.51.100.64/26 eq bgp
      ! ‚Ä¶

This intentionally breaks any BGP session between the peers and our
route servers **and** all direct peerings to other peers in the peering
LAN on the switch in maintenance. BGP sessions that do not terminate on
the switch under maintenance continue to work, though.

When the maintenance is completed, these ACEs will be removed and the
BGP sessions recover. This allows us to do (emergency) maintenances
without directly interacting with all affected peers.

== Route Servers

Our route servers run on dedicated hardware `Alpine
Linux <https://alpinelinux.org>`__ in `diskless
mode <https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Installation#Diskless_Mode>`__
allowing for robust operation, see `prior RIPE Labs
article <https://labs.ripe.net/author/liske/ixp-from-scratch-network-and-security-design/>`__.
We use a single `bird2 <https://bird.network.cz/>`__ instance as routing
daemon.

=== Isolate the Peering LAN

The route servers are connected to the management LAN and the peering
LAN. For security reasons, it is important that network packets are
never routed between those networks. Deploying firewall rules is the
first step but not sufficient. We also need to tune ARP responses and
other settings of the Linux kernel to achieve full isolation.

The Linux kernel provides a lightweight built-in solution to implement
partitioning of kernel resources such as user IDs, file system,
processes, or the network stack. So called `network namespaces
(netns) <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-netns.8.html#DESCRIPTION>`__
enable the creation of partitions with their own isolated IP routing
configuration. Processes and interfaces can be moved between netns as
required. Our route servers have a bonding link (LAG) where the VLANs of
the *PoP Management LAN* and the *Peering LAN* are attached.

image:003_ixp_rs.webp[]

The *Peering LAN* subinterface and the BIRD BGP daemon are assigned to
the ``peering`` network namespace. While network namespaces in Linux
provide a hard isolation for any IP-based connection, it does **not**
affect *UNIX domain sockets*. So we can still use the BIRD CLI ``birdc``
from the default network namespace (**mw: which is what?**) to manage
the BIRD daemon running inside the peering netns. This also works for
monitoring tools such as *birdwatcher* and *bird_exporter*.

image:003_rs_netns.webp[]

Alpine Linux has built-in support to `run daemons inside network
namespaces <https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Netns#netns-based_Service_Isolation>`__.
We use `IfState <https://ifstate.net>`__ to have a fully declarative
network configuration (disclaimer:
`Thomas <https://labs.ripe.net/author/liske/>`__ is upstream developer
of IfState). IfState also has native netns support allowing us to
configure such setup easily (see our `jinja2 template for
/etc/ifstate/config.yml <https://github.com/dd-ix/ddix-ansible-rs/blob/10c7e4d4a2076f1153913801ed940c23eb6c199c/templates/ifstate/config.yml.j2>`__).

== BGP Configuration

The BGP configuration of IXP route servers must prevent the distribution
of incorrect routing information between peers. `RFC
7947 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7947>`__ and `RFC
7948 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7948>`__ provide a good
overview of important requirements. Instead of implementing policies to
ignore invalid routes from scratch, we use a well-known and tested
framework.

=== Exclude Invalid Routes from Advertisement

At DD-IX, we build the basic BIRD configuration of our route servers
using `ARouteServer <https://github.com/pierky/arouteserver>`__ provided
by Pier Carlo Chiodi. Our configuration of ARouteServer is available in
our `DD-IX Ansible
IXP <https://github.com/dd-ix/ddix-ansible-ixp/tree/main/arouteserver>`__
repository. The BIRD configurations are automatically rebuilt and
activated several times a day to reflect changes of route objects,
`RPKI <https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/resource-management/rpki/>`__
material etc.

== Transparency is Important

Debugging in case of errors, unexpected behavior etc. requires full
transparency into the configuration of our route severs. To make most
recent configurations available to our peers, we use the built-in
feature of *ARouteServer* to create a textual representation of the
route server options and policies, and publish the output automatically
on our `website <https://dd-ix.net/en/network/route-server>`__.

== IPv4 Prefixes and an IPv6 Next Hop?

`RFC 8950 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8950>`__ defines the
option to advertise IPv4 prefixes with an IPv6 Next Hop. This feature is
supported by *ARouteServer*. Although this feature seems not to be
provided by many IXPs, yet, we decided to try this feature in our
greenfield setup. Unfortunately, we had to deactivate it for now because
it conflicts with our monitoring setup.

== Conclusions

We would like to emphasize the following take-aways.

1. Running a larger switching infrastructure that is allows for fast
   failovers and use available resources flexibly, is more than
   deploying link aggregation and spanning tree. There is no need,
   however, for proprietary solutions. Open IETF technologies for
   virtualization perfectly work.

2. Securing your peering LAN is a must but it also introduces
   complexity, especially when it comes to debugging L3 filters. In our
   next article, we will describe how we generate our configurations and
   ACLs.

3. `RFC 8950 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8950/>`__ still has
   some issues that hinder its use, mainly because software such as the
   Alice Looking Glass do not support integration.

4. A route server should not propagate any route advertised by a peer.
   Tools are available to compile a list of invalid routes, but it also
   requires input from operators ‚Äì create RPKI ROAs (and filter) ;)!

5. IPv6 introduce special consideration of link-local addresses.
   Currently, our community does not have a clear understanding which
   addressing scheme should be used. This, however, is a requirement for
   the creation of filter rules. We hope that this will be clarified
   among IXPs in the future.
