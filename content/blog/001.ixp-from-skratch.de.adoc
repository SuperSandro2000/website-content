== IXP-from-Scratch: Building a New Public Internet Echange

[width="5%",cols="100%",]
|===
|In this new series "`IXP from Scratch`", we report about our endeavor
of building DD-IX, an Internet Exchange located in the city of Dresden,
Germany. DD-IX is driven by a grassroots community that loves
contributing to a resilient and efficient Internet. We start with basic
background, and will share technical design decisions in upcoming
articles.
|===

=== Believe it or not, the Internet is still a community project.

The Internet is a network of networks and Internet Exchange Points are
crucial part of the underlying infrastructure. They facilitate public
and local interconnections between networks, which increases resiliency
because of higher interconnectivity and reduces delays because of
vicinity. They are a place where networks meet technically and
non-technically.

In autumn 2023, we founded the https://dd-ix.net[DD-IX Dresden Internet
Exchange] association with the objective to improve interconnectivity in
the city of Dresden, Germany and the region of Saxony. Now that we are
going into operation, we would like to share how we designed and
implemented DD-IX. In a loose series of articles, we will discuss
various technical aspects from the perspective of a small IX, such as:

* network and security design
* peering LAN hardening
* configuration automation
* observability and validation.

Before we go into more technical details in the following articles,
let’s talk about a few non-technical points, too.

_Disclaimer: In this and future articles, we do not argue that our
design decisions are perfect nor the only way to go, even though we
thoroughly thought about them. If you have different opinions or want to
share other experiences, we are very much looking forward to your
comments below._

=== Keep Local Traffic Local

The DD-IX was founded by a grassroots community that believes in the key
principle of an IXP: Keep local traffic local. There are various
Internet providers and network operators of different sizes in Dresden
and the larger region of Saxony. Direct interconnectivity, however, was
(or still is ;)) very low. We are dissatisfied that traffic between
providers in the city often leaves even the federal state and travels
several hundred kilometres, only to be routed, for example, from Berlin
or Frankfurt back to Dresden.

In addition to lower latencies, supporting the principle of keeping
local traffic local brings another benefit: diversity in the peering
infrastructure and, as a consequence, robustness. Local peering
facilities operated by independent associations, companies, or other
organisations are in contrast to telecommunication providers aiming for
consolidation. Having a single point of contact may seem convenient for
a customer, especially when you need to span multiple geographical
regions, but relying on a single organisation fosters monopolies. At
DD-IX, we believe in the advantages of diversity.

=== Being a neutral peering platform

The DD-IX is operated by an association registered in Germany whose
members are exclusively private individuals. Our
https://content.dd-ix.net/documents/download/DD-IX_Satzung.pdf[Statutes]
and https://content.dd-ix.net/documents/download/DD-IX_CoC_EN.pdf[Code
of Conduct] ensure that the IX stays a neutral and independent peering
platform. Members of the DD-IX association have voting rights to steer
the association.

Peering at DD-IX does not require to be a member of the association. Our
https://dd-ix.net/de/peering/policy[Peering Policy] governs conditions
and guidelines for peering at DD-IX.

=== Services we provide

First and foremost, an IXP is a peering platform. It provides layer 2
connectivity based on one or multiple switches and a route server to
ease the setup of BGP sessions. Operating such a peering infrastructure
requires yet other internal services, which are not directly offered to
members or peers but necessary to run the daily business.

==== External Services

We decided to start operations at two Points of Presence (PoP) from the
beginning, due to the requirements of our peers. Both PoPs are equipped
with a route server and are connected redundantly. To find potentials
PoPs and members in your region, https://www.peeringdb.com/[PeeringDB]
is of great help – if you run your own network, maintain your entries
;).

We have decided to officially not offering physical 1GbE ports in order
to simplify upgrades of our switching hardware. We plan offering private
VLAN interconnects between our peers in the near future.

DD-IX also operates an anycast name server instance of the
https://www.as112.net[AS112 project] to resolve reverse lookup queries
for non-unique IP addresses locally. We announce AS112 on our route
servers to all peers.

==== Internal Services

Internal services include a firewall, authentication handling, cloud
services to share documents, a documentation platform, DNS, email etc.
When we designed our local network, we explicitly decided to rely on
IPv6 only, which was partly a challenge by its own.

To conclude, running an IXP is more than just providing some switch
ports. We will write about the technical details and lessons learned in
future RIPE Labs articles. Just look for IXP-from-Scratch.

=== Hardware we received

We started operation thanks to the support of several organisations that
provided us access to hardware, including:

* server hardware to run our route servers, a firewall, and a
virtualisation server.
* colocation rack space in two data centres.
* two Arista DCS-7050SX switches supporting BGP eVPN.
* many Flexoptix SFP+ ports.
* Arista 7148S layer 2 switches.

This enabled us to start directly with a network design that can be
easily scaled up later on.

=== Acknowledgements

The Internet is a community project, and we consider us lucky to
experience this directly since the DD-IX journey started. Many people,
ISPs, and IXPs encouraged us to continue. Thanks! Several companies
supported us in a very early stage. Thanks DSI, IBH, Flexoptix. We would
like to use the opportunity to thank Steffen David, André Grüneberg, and
René Fichtmüller for fruitful discussions. Thanks to RIPE to provide a
home for this series of articles.
